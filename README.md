This project aims to detect similarity between two python codes. First, we remove all the annotation from the text, thus get the meaningful parts of the code. Then, we process the codes and use Levenshtein package and Universal Sentence Encoder to get the similarity values.  

Running insturctions:

python3 detect_sim.py -f1 path_to_first_code -f2 path_to_second_code

The "BMI_final_report.pdf" is the report for this homework.
